## System Overview

Ell-ena is designed to be your all-in-one assistant for managing tasks and meetings. Whether it's creating a ticket for that dark mode feature or adding a to-do item for your math assignment, Ell-ena understands the context and enriches your requests automatically. Built with scalability in mind, it offers real-time task creation and management while leveraging advanced AI and NLP to streamline your workflow.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Next.js UI**: A modern, responsive interface built with Next.js, offering a slick and interactive user experience.
- **Chat Interface**: A conversational UI that lets you speak to Ell-ena as if chatting with a friend.
- **Context Viewer**: A component that displays detailed task context and progress.

### 2. Backend Layer
- **FastAPI Server**: A high-performance backend API built on FastAPI that processes your commands quickly.
- **Task & Ticket Engine**: Manages the creation, updating, and tracking of tasks and tickets.
- **Meeting Transcription Service**: Transcribes meeting audio in real time and converts it into actionable insights.
- **Graph RAG Module**: Utilizes Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation to efficiently pull and process contextual data.

### 3. Integration & AI Layer
- **NLP and AI Modules**: Power the understanding of natural language inputs and context extraction.
- **Context Manager**: Aggregates and maintains work context across multiple interactions.

### 4. Data & Storage Layer
- **Primary Database**: Stores user data, tasks, tickets, and transcriptions.
- **Cache & Queue System**: Ensures fast real-time processing and task scheduling (using Redis and Celery/RabbitMQ).
